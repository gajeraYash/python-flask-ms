# Microservices with Python, Flask and Docker

Welcome to my sample project focused on building knowledge around Microservices architecture using Python, Flask, and Docker. Microservices offer a modern approach to structuring applications, breaking them down into smaller, cohesive services that are easier to maintain, test, and deploy independently.

## What are Microservices?
Microservices represent an architectural style and pattern where an application is composed of multiple loosely coupled services. Each service is designed to be highly maintainable, testable, and focused on a specific functionality. By breaking down the application into smaller services, developers can achieve greater flexibility and scalability.

## Why Microservices?
The Microservices approach offers several advantages:

- **Modularity**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for easier maintenance and updates.
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand, leading to more efficient resource utilization.
- **Resilience**: Failures in one service do not necessarily affect the entire application, leading to increased resilience and fault tolerance.
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can be implemented using different technologies, enabling teams to choose the best tools for each task.
